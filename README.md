We develop AI based software for crypto ATMs with the possibility of decentralized funds exchange.
The main aim of our solution is to reduce crypto ATMs servicing costs.

Unlike the traditional ATMs, our algorithm uses blockchain transactions data. 

Moreover, in case the ATM runs out of cash there is a provided possibility of decentralized stablecoin exchange.
